% Rules to query the database

% 1. Find DOB for a given name
get_dob(Name, DOB) :-
    person(Name, DOB).

% 2. Find all names born in a specific year
born_in_year(Year, Name) :-
    person(Name, date(Year, _, _)).

% 3. Find all names born in a specific month
born_in_month(Month, Name) :-
    person(Name, date(_, Month, _)).

born_between_years(StartYear, EndYear, Name) :-
    person(Name, date(Year, _, _)),
    Year >= StartYear,
    Year =< EndYear.

% 5. Calculate age (assuming current date is 2023-10-15 for example)
age(Name, Age) :-
    person(Name, date(Year, Month, Day)),
    CurrentDate = date(2023, 10, 15),
    age_calculation(date(Year, Month, Day), CurrentDate, Age).

age_calculation(date(BY, BM, BD), date(CY, CM, CD), Age) :-
    (CY > BY, CM > BM -> Age is CY - BY;
     CY > BY, CM =:= BM, CD >= BD -> Age is CY - BY;
     CY > BY -> Age is CY - BY - 1;
     Age = 0).
